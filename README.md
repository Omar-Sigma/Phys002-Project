# Phys002-Project
This is related to our Nile University PHYS002 project.

This is a GUI tool for defining certain values in an arduino file. It is supposed to make the user define:-
          1.The distance between the sensor and the container
          2.The container's depth.
          3.And the maximum water level (where the arduino prints an "Off" status if this value is reached)

The files:-
          1.ANgui.py: This is the main gui file
          2.the text files with the .txtcon extension are there for testing the application's write functionality
          3.The other files are for testing purposes.
          4.codetest.ino and codetest.c are for testing purposes as well.

Important note:
In order for the gui to run, you need to have python3 installed with pip.
You also need to install ttkthemes using pip.
You can do so by issuing the following command in the terminal:-
          pip install ttkthemes
or
          pip3 install ttkthemes
